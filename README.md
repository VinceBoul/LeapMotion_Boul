LeapMotion_Boul
===============

An application which shows some fonctionnalities of the Leap motion

This application is made with Eclipse.

In Eclipse, import as a project the folder LeapTest.
Make sure you've configured the Build Path to get the libraries.

I'm beginning to develope with the leap motion so I put aside the design what I've done. 
But I think some parts of the code might help some people to quickly understand how it works.
